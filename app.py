# Upload this file to GitHub along with Procfile and requirements.txt.
# Then, in GitHub, open app.py, click the edit (pencil) icon,
# DELETE everything in this file, and paste in your full, final app.py
# from ChatGPT (the baseline version with:
# - EMA freshness logic
# - pending trade queue
# - flatten-before-new-entry
# - 2-contract entries
# - 2 take-profit exits).
#
# This placeholder exists only so the ZIP structure is valid.
#
# Example minimal Flask structure (won't be used in production):
